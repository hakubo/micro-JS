micro JS framework
==================

micro JS (or better m.js) is an attempt to deliver a compact and optimized JS *framework* (in the jQuery meaning) targeted at modern HTML5-enabled browsers.

Why
---
m.js is the answer to an internal need of the **Wikia Mobile team** for a faster JS framework to build the best mobile web experience possible.

m.js tries to do what *jQuery* is not able to deliver in terms of code size and *Zepto* is not able to accomplish in terms of performances.

How
---
The main differences with mainstream libraries of the same kind are:

* extremely compact size of the code
* minimal amount of *polyfill* code
* no superfluous sugar syntax
* built on the results of accurate benchmarks to be as fast as possible
* no non-sense selectors implementation
* respect of the *DOM API*

How to help
-----------
The code is released under the *MIT license* and is open for everyone to contribute.

If you're not a developer and still would like to help, hold tight as we'll release a set of unit/benchmark tests you will be able to run on your browser (especially on less common mobile devices and tablets) and submit feedback back to us to keep improving the quality of our code.

If you just want to use it in your project, feel free to drop us a line, we would be happy to know of anything cool this framework helped building.
